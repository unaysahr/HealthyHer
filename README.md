# HealthyHer

## Inspiration
I wanted to create a website that helps teenage girls develop healthy eating habits in a way that's simple and easy. These days, there is such an unhealthy focus on body images, and social media and fast food culture can promote bad eating habits and make this problem even worse. According to research done at Tufts University, about 67% of adolescent suffer from poor diet. To combat this, I wanted to create an website that can help teenagers manage their food choices and make healthy decisions in way that's not overwhelming or stressful.

## What it does
HealthyHer uses Gemini API to analyze the meal in the uploaded image and provide the calorie count and advice on the meal.

## How we built it
I built it using the VS code IDE, and used Python programming. I used three libraries: streamlit, google.generativeai, and python-dotenv. Streamlit helped with the creation of the web application, google.generativeai allowed to me access and implement Google's generative AIs, which in this was Gemini. Python-dotenv helped to manage my environment variables and to hide the API key.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge I ran into was trying to figure out a prompt for Gemini in order to produce a result that was not only accurate but also simple and easy to read. Too much information would be a problem, especially for younger users who are not familiar with specific terminology.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of creating an app that can help empower teenage girls into making healthy food choices that can help them even later in life. 

## What we learned
While making this project I learned a lot of implementing AI into code and into our everyday lives. AI can sound like a confusing and overwhelming thing, but it's surprisingly easy to use.

## What's next for HealthyHer
Next, I'm thinking of making HealthyHer into a mobile app in order to reach a wider audience. I would also like to implement a social aspect into it, where users would be able to share their healthy food choices with other users.
